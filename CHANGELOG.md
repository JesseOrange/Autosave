# 1.1 (Oct 21, 2018)
* `Autosave.exe` now passes its first argument to `sai2.exe`. It means `Autosave.exe` can be renamed into `sai2.exe` and that won't affect `.sai2` files (in case this file extension is registered in the system)
* Small changes in the “About” message

# 1.0 (Jan 09, 2017)
* Initial version
